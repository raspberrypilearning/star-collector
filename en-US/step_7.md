## Upgrade your project

Customize your game so that it plays just the way you want it to.

Spend some time playing your game. What changes will make the user experience better for this minigame?

You could:
+ Add more stars to collect and more walls to hide the stars behind
+ Try changing the colour, font, and size of the text in the TextMeshPro GameObject in the Inspector window
+ Adjust the settings on the Particle System to get the effect you want
+ Add other GameObjects to collect; there are hearts and four-leafed clovers in the Models folder
+ Make the game more difficult over time; make the Player go slower or lose some collected stars
+ Store the time taken in a variable and give time penalties for collecting different objects
+ Change the camera angle
