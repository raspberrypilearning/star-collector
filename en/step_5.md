## Keeping time

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">

Now that a player can collect stars, add a timer to show the amount of time taken to collect all three stars.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Game mechanics**</span> are a key part of game design. They are the rules that control a player's actions. A **timer** is a game mechanic that adds a challenge to video games â€” in fact, there are many Guinness World Records based on how quickly players can complete challenges in games!
</p>

The player needs to keep track of how long they are taking to complete the minigame, you can do this with another variable. 

--- task ---

In the Hierarchy window, right-click on your **Canvas** and from **UI** create another **Text - TextMeshPro GameObject**. You will see 'New Text' written on your screen in Game view: 

![The Game view with a 'New Text' UI text item showing across the screen.](images/new-timer.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Right-click on the new **Text (TMP) GameObject** and select **rename**. Call it `Time Text` to easily identify it:

![Renamed Time GameObject in the Hierarchy window.](images/time-gameobject.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the Inspector window, in the Text Input property for the new TextMeshPro GameObject, change `New Text` to `Time: 0`.

Use the **Rect Transform** component to change the alignment to **Top Right**. Also change the position to `x = -60`, `y = -50`:

--- /task ---

The text that is displayed needs to update so that it continuously shows the number of seconds since the game started.

--- task ---

Open your `StarPlayer` script and add code to create a TMP_Text Object called `timeText`: 

--- code ---
---
language: cs
filename: StarPlayer.cs
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 6
line_highlights: 10
---
public class StarPlayer : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int stars = 0; // An integer whole number
    public TMP_Text starText;
    public TMP_Text timeText;
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

`Time.time` gives the time in seconds since the Scene started. `Mathf.Round` turns a number into a whole number. 

Set the text to show the number of whole seconds on each update:

--- code ---
---
language: cs
filename: StarPlayer.cs - Update()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 21
---
    void Update()
    {
        starText.SetText("Stars: " + stars);
        timeText.SetText("Time: " + Mathf.Round(Time.time));
    }
--- /code ---

Save your script and go back to the Unity Editor. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Select the Player in the Hierarchy window and go to the `Star Player` script component in the Inspector window. Click on the circle next to `Time Text` and choose your new 'Time Text' object. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your minigame and check that the time updates as you play. What happens when you collect all three stars?

--- /task ---

The time needs to stop when all three stars are collected, but currently it will keep counting up for as long as the minigame is playing. 

--- task ---

Open the `StarPlayer` script and create an if statement around your time code to only count the seconds if the player has collected less than three stars:

--- code ---
---
language: cs
filename: StarPlayer.cs - Update()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 21-24
---
    void Update()
    {
        starText.SetText("Stars: " + stars);
        if (stars < 3)
        {
            timeText.SetText("Time: " + Mathf.Round(Time.time));
        }
    }
--- /code ---

Save your script and go back to the Unity Editor. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your minigame again. The timer will stop when the player has three stars:

After the Quiz, you can upgrade your project with the features you think are important.
