Spend some time playing your game. What changes will make the user experience better whilst they are playing the minigame?
+ More stars to collect and more walls to hide the stars behind.
+ Try changing the colour, font and size of the text in the TextMeshPro GameObject in the Inspector.
+ Adjust the settings on the Particle System to get the effect you want. 
+ Add other GameObjects to collect. There are hearts and four-leafed clovers in the 'Models' folder. 
+ Make the game more difficult over time. Make the Player go slower or lose some collected stars. 
+ Store the time taken in a variable and give time penalties for collecting different objects. 
+ Change the camera angle.
