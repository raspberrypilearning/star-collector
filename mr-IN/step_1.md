## Introduction

Make a minigame where you collect spinning stars as fast as you can.

This project is brought to you with generous support from [Unity Technologies](https://unity.com/){:target="_blank"}.  These [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} offer young people the opportunity to take their first steps in creating virtual worlds using Real-Time 3D.

This project follows on from [Explore a 3D world](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/explore-a-3d-world){:target="_blank"}. You can use the Unity scene that you created in that project as the basis for this project. We've also provided a starter project that you can use.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**minigame**</span> is a short computer game. Larger computer games often contain multiple minigames. Do you play any games that contain minigames?
</p>

You will:

+ Use **colliders** and **triggers** to control what happens when GameObjects collide
+ Add **sound** and **particle effects**
+ Create, set, and display score and time **variables**

### Try it

Click on the embedded project. Try and collect the stars as fast as you can. How close do you have to be to a star to collect it? What happens to the time when you have collected all of the stars? What graphic effects do the stars have?
