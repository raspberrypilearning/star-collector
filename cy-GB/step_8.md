If you are following the [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/unity-intro){:target="_blank"} path, you can move on to the [Non-player characters](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/non-player-characters){:target="_blank"} project. In this project, you will add non-player characters (NPCs) to your game to help you or make things more difficult.
